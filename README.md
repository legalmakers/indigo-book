# Indigo Book
*An unofficial repository containing the unofficial Indigo Book public-domain citation project (unofficially, of course).*

This repository contains a copy of the raw HTML behind *The Indigo Book*, a public-domain citation guide for legal materials. 
*See* Sprigman, et al., *The Indigo Book: A Manual of Legal Citation*, Public Resource (2016). Its unusual color choice stems 
from protests by the publisher of a book of a different color; more details are on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indigo_Book).

This repository is doubly unofficial. having no affiliation with the publisher of the Indigo 
Book. The publisher hosts the authoritative copy on [law.resource.org](https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/blue/IndigoBook.html), 
alongside a [PDF version](https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/blue/IndigoBook.pdf) for those who prefer
that format. (Both of those links were last visited on May 1, 2016.)

## Purpose of this Repository

One of the interesting features of *The Indigo Book* is that it has been published in HTML, which opens
up new possibilities for making tools that work with legal citations. To take the simplest example, one
could write a script or macro that automatically abbreviates specific words in a case name, 
using this HTML as a data source. Many other possibilities come to mind. If you make something cool 
using *The Indigo Book* as a foundation, please feel free to share. That's what GitHub is for, after all, 
and the famous [Venn diagram about there being no lawyers on GitHub](http://blog.ted.com/further-reading-in-github/)
is [not strictly speaking true](https://github.com/dpp/lawyersongithub).
